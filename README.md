1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?      
   var is function-scoped and hoisted, let is block-scoped and can be reassigned, const is block-scoped but cannot be reassigned after declaration.    
2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?    
   map() returns a new transformed array, forEach() executes a function for each element (no return), filter() returns a new array with elements that pass a test.    
3) What are arrow functions in ES6?    
   Arrow functions are a concise syntax for writing functions, with lexical this binding.    
4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?    
   Destructuring extracts values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables using a syntax that mirrors the structure.    
5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?    
   Template literals use backticks () and ${} for interpolation, allowing multiline strings and embedded expressions, unlike concatenation which uses+` operator.
